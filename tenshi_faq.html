    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Why don't you use File::Tail ?</strong></p>

      <p>File::Tail has serious performance and synchronization issues, if you
      use it for high performance log analysis things will go terribly wrong. Trust
      us on that.</p>

      <p><strong>How's tenshi different from other tools like swatch,
      logwatch, logsentry, sec, etc, etc... ?</strong></p>

      <p>Quoting <a href="http://marc.info/?l=loganalysis&m=113657727325755&w=2">this post</a>:</p>

      <p> There are no definitive points against one or other apps for most
      people, sometimes you just have to "feel" what works for you.</p>

      <p>Anyway the biggest difference from logcheck/logsentry (besides tenshi
      being actively maintained) is flexibility, tenshi is much more powerful in how
      the reports should be assigned/constructed, and the whole concept of queues and
      timing of the different queue checks that logsentry lacks. We also like to
      think that tenshi is cleaner implementation/documentation and packaging wise
      ;). Tenshi also runs as a daemon btw and it's not driven by crontab.  </p>

      <p>Also we are really tired of pointing out that we are not like swatch!
      Since tenshi came out everyone was asking why are we doing this since swatch is
      out there. Again swatch has no concept of queues and we don't provide an exec
      target at the moment along with no interactive things like the "beep" action.
      Tenshi's main point is summarization (along with instant notifications) and
      that's something swatch can't do (like logsentry). We don't have throttling btw
      (while swatch has something for that), but it wasn't an immediate need since
      summarization is what we rely on. I think that with thresholding you can have
      swatch doing something similar to tenshi but still tenshi should provide a
      better/easier implementation for these kind of things.  Swatch seems
      over-complicated to us.</p>

      <p>Logwatch values its default set of rules, we don't have such thing and
      we ask users to understand and feed their own rules, and let's say that we find
      logwatch messy and overly complicated for what it has to do.</p>

      <p>Our main objective was providing something powerful and actually useful
      without overcomplicating configuration and the code, performance was also a
      main issue for us along with a clean distribution/packaging.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I use the CSV output feature?</strong></p>

      <p>This is an example for graphing tenshi output using
      <a href="http://afterglow.sf.net">AfterGlow</a> and <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz</a>:</p>

      <p>Use something like this in your tenshi configuration:</p>

<pre class="code">
set csv [0 * * * *] /usr/local/bin/tenshi_graph.sh
</pre>

      <p>Where tenshi_graph.sh could be</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh /usr/local/bin/afterglow.pl -c /etc/afterglow.conf -t | neato -v -Tpng -o /var/lib/tenshi/tenshi_graph.png
</pre>

      <p>and afterglow.conf configuration could be something like</p>

<pre class="code">
color.source="green";
color.target="red"       if ($fields[2] &gt; 1000);
color.target="orange"    if ($fields[2] &gt; 500);
color.target="blue"      if ($fields[2] &gt; 100);
color.target="lightblue" if ($fields[2] &gt; 50);
color.target="yellow"    if ($fields[2] == 1);
color.target="white";
</pre>

      <p>This allows having target node colours depending on the number of hits
      of the affected log, but of course it might be whatever conditions you want.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind that in order to have useful and readable graphs your tenshi
      configuration must be accordingly tuned. Arbitrary logs in the csv queue would
      quickly generate huge and unreadable node maps.</p>

      <p>This is merely one example, more advanced processing can be done with custom configuration.</p>
